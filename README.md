# haskell-config-example

This is how I configure Haskell applications from multiple sources (flags, environment variables, json files etc), very much inspired by golang's [viper][viper] library. You're welcome to copy it and adapt it to your needs. I don't think it's possible to lift this pattern out into a library without being overly opinionated.
